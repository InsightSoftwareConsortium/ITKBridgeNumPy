This is a port from the PyBuffer as ITK4 module.

Differences to original PyBuffer
 - Support for VectorImages (only for GetArrayFromImage)
 - Option to not swap the axes (only for GetArrayFromImage)
 - Some rudimental tests
 - No support for numarray

TODO:
 - add features also to GetImageFromArray
 - improve test
